This is my Power Bi project worked on Adventure work Sales Data added the dataset in the repo.

Performed Cleaning and Formatting of data in Power Query and Loaded in Power Bi Desktop

Build relationships among the tables in the modeling tab and with the help of data view we can inspect, explore, and understand data in our Power BI Desktop model

With the help of Visualizations pane built interactive visuals from the data loaded 

In Power Bi my favorite visuals are:

Line Chart - To see the trend where we are standing in business now*
Pie Chart - To know the how much percentage of area occupied*
Guage Visual - To check the target vs actual status*
AI Visuals especially Key Influencers where we can check which factors are mainly impacting towards profit or loss*
